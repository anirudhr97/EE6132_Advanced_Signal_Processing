# EE6132 - Advanced Signal Processing
Repository containing the lab assignments done as part of the EE6132 - Advanced Signal Processing(DL in Imaging) course at IITM under Prof. AN Rajagopalan.

Each assignment is uploaded as a separate folder which contains the objective/problem statement(named ```PS.pdf```) as well as my code(named ```Code.ipynb```) and report(named ```Report.pdf```). All Deep Learning models were implemented using PyTorch. The trained PyTorch models can be found in ```Models.zip```.
